                            example, to address a security threat. Minor changes will not affect your use of the

                        As is the case with other gifts, it is not our policy to offer both a refund and a resend. Where
                        flowers have been damaged we will normally ask for photographs clearly showing the problem so we
                        can use them to determine what is going wrong with our system or our couriers. Refunds cannot be
                        given for flowers that have died quickly unless we understand there to be a genuine problem. It
                        is important that flowers are cared for correctly and in line with the instructions provided.
                        Putting them by heat sources or draughts, or failing to change the water will damage them. We
                        include instructions and flower food with all our arrangements. All flowers should normally last
                        five days or longer, although this varies by variety. In some circumstances, flowers are sent in
                        the bud and will not be fully open when they arrive. However, they should open once they have
                        settled at room temperature.

                        You can set up reminders for your upcoming events (Reminder) on your Boonify Account or during
                        the checkout process and you may benefit from discounts from time to time.
                    </p>

                        The Reminder must be set at least two (2) weeks before the date of your event (Event Date).
                        Before your Event Date, we will send you a push/email notification to remind you of the Event
                        Date. This push/email notification includes details about the Reminder Voucher offer (where
                        applicable) which is valid for 7 days.

                        Your Reminder Voucher (where applicable) will automatically be generated and applied to your
                        session when you click on the email link or tap on the notification. When you log into your
                        Boonify Account, the Reminder Voucher (where applicable) will be applied to your basket.

                        Each Reminder is considered to be a marketing activity. By setting up Reminders, you are giving
                        Boonify permission to email or notify you about the Event Date, even if you are opted out of
                        other marketing activity (for instance, newsletters). To stop getting Reminders, you need to
                        delete the Reminders that you have set up from your Boonify Account.

                        if we are obliged or advised to comply with an order, instruction or request of any limb of
                        government, or any regulator, court or other competent authority.

                    <p class="">
                        These Terms may change from time to time and when they do, we will post the new version of the
                        Terms on the Website and the App and flag it appropriately.

                    <p class="">
                        Unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and Boonify, this Terms constitutes the sole
                        agreement between you and Boonify for your use and the provision of the Platform/Services and
                        the subject matter hereof, and unless other agreed or incorporated herein, no representations,
                        statements or inducements, oral or written, not contained in this Terms shall bind either you or
                        Boonify.

                    <h3 class="">* Severance</h3>
                    <p class="">
                        If any provision of these Terms is prohibited by law or judged by a court to be unlawful, void
                        or unenforceable, the provision shall, to the extent required, be severed from these Terms and
                        rendered ineffective as far as possible without modifying the remaining provisions of this
                        Terms, and shall not in any way affect any other circumstances of or the validity or enforcement
                        of this Terms.

                    <h3 class="">* Waiver</h3>
                    <p class="">
                        Failure to insist on the performance of any of the terms will not operate as a waiver of any
                        subsequent default. No waiver by Boonify of any right under this Terms will be deemed to be
                        either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at
                        any other time. Any waiver of any right or obligation under this Term shall only be valid if it
                        is in writing and signed by the Party waiving such right.

                    <p class="">
                        You shall not assign, transfer or novate your rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in
                        part without the prior written consent of Boonify.

                    <p class="">
                        These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties and the
                        parties' respective successors and permitted assigns. A printed version of these Terms and of
                        any related notice given in electronic form shall be valid and admissible in judicial or
                        administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject
                        to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and
                        maintained in printed form.
